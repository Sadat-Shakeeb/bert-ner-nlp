# bert-ner-nlp
The primary goal of this project is to fine-tune a pre-trained bert-base-cased model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CoNLL-2003 dataset. The objective is to identify and classify specific entities (Person, Location, Organization, Miscellaneous) within text, using the standard IOB2 tagging scheme.
